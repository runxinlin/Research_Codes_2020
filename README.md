The effect of monetary policy on long-run stock price reversals on the JSE

Abstract
Purpose:The  study  expands  on  the  phenomenon  of  long-run  reversal  in  the  financial  markets  using Johannesburg StockExchange  (JSE)  data. This  study  aimedto  determine  whether  the  monetary  policy changes implemented by the South African Reserve Bank influence long-run reversals in the JSE.

Context:Long-run reversals have occurred in various global financial markets in the US,Europe,Asia,and South Africa. Long-run reversals occur when firms with poor past performance rebound and produce  superior  returns to firms with good historical past performance. South  Africa  has  a  monetary policy  of  inflation  targeting. It tends to increase  interest  rates  whenever  the change in the consumer price index falls above the upper limit of the range of 3â€“6%.

Methods:The  regressions  of  the  Fama-French  three  factors  model  and the Fama-MacBeth model were used to estimate the relationship between the excess  return of  different  portfolio returns and the Fama-Frenchthree   factors.   Furthermore,  we split our sample under expansive and restrictive monetary  conditions. We ranthe  regression  of the Fama-MacBeth model againtosee whether the monetary conditions influence the long-run reversal.

Results:The  sample  results  over  the  near  15-year  sample  period  show  that  firms  with  poor  past performance  failed  to  outperform those with past  solid performance. In addition, monetary policy changes did notlead to long-run reversals among poor performingfirms. The gap is closed under restrictive monetary conditions.Practical value:The study recommends that one could do a detailed examination ofthe relationship between  firm  characteristics and long-run reversals  under  various  monetary conditions. Monetary conditions  are  worth  watching  for  when  constituting  a  portfolio because  they  create  arbitrage opportunities for astute investors.
